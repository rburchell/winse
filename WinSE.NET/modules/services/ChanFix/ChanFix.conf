# First of all - a note to those who use ircds with vhosts:
# CHANFIX ONLY LOOKS AT THE REAL USERNAME AND HOSTNAME FOR MASKS.
# It never displays any of this information however, except to IRCops who can usually get at it anyway.
# Main chanfix configuration section. [REQUIRED]
[ChanFix]
# This sets ChanFix's nickname. [OPTIONAL (Default is ChanFix)]
MyNick=ChanFix
# This sets ChanFix's username. [OPTIONAL (Default is chanfix)]
MyUser=chanfix
# This sets ChanFix's hostname. [OPTIONAL (Default is the services server name)]
#MyHost=just.pretend.I.am.not.here
# This sets ChanFix's realname. [OPTIONAL (Default is Channel Fixer)]
MyReal=Channel Fixer
# This is the minimum number of users a channel must have before ChanFix will record scores for it.
# If there are less than this many users in the channel, ChanFix will completely ignore it.[REQUIRED]
MinUsers=2
# This is the minimum number of recorded ops a channel must have for ChanFix to fix it. [REQUIRED]
MinChanops=5
# This is the minimum amount of time an op must have been opped to be considered "recorded".
# Ops that do not meet this requirement will still have scores tracked, but will not count
# towards MinChanops, nor will they ever be opped during a fix operation.
# This is expressed as an integer indicating the number of 5 minute periods. [REQUIRED]
# Example: 1 = 5 minutes, 10 = 50 minutes, 12 = 1 hour. 288 = 1 full day.
MinChanopTime=12
# Channel ops are recorded by their full user@host.domain mask. Normally, channel ops
# will be required to have a working identd server (no ~ in front of the username), but
# this can be disabled (for example, if the ircd does not support identd checking and just
# ~s all usernames regardless of if identd is present or not). [OPTIONAL (Default is NO)]
DontRequireIdentd=No
# How many days should pass before data is removed. The default is 14, which
# is two weeks. [OPTIONAL]
DataExpire=14
# Enable the potentially abusive OPME command? If you enable this, ChanFix admins can be
# granted the ability to use the command to op themselves on a channel, useful in cases
# where a channel must be fixed without ChanFix, however in most cases it will probably
# just be abused, so enable this only if think you'll ever need it. [OPTIONAL (Default is NO)]
EnableOpMe=No
# Ignore any leading ~ in usernames. This means that when comparing user addresses, ChanFix
# will pretend any leading ~ does not exist. This is only useful in two cases:
# - When DontRequireIdentd is set to Yes.
# - Admin user@host masks.
# [OPTIONAL (Default is NO)]
IgnoreTilde=No
# If IgnoreTilde is No, this enables more intellegent comparisons between a username in a mask
# and a username that was ~'d. This enables matches in cases where the username was cut off
# (which can be useful at times when a user's identd server is temporarily broken). For example:
# ~moo will match moo@, and helloworld will match helloworld@ but ~helloworld is too long. Some
# IRCDs limit usernames to 10 characters, and so the username would be shortend to ~helloworl.
# With SmartTildeMatching on, ~helloworl will still match helloworld@. [OPTIONAL (Default is NO)]
SmartTildeMatching=No
# Now configure a list of users who can get access to ChanFix. You will then create a [Section]
# for each of these. The name of the section will be the name after the = sign here.
# No spaces allowed. Multiple may be defined, but at least ONE is [REQUIRED].
Admin=CFixAdmin

#This is the section that you MUST create for each Admin= directive.
[CFixAdmin]
# First a list of user@host addresses this admin may login from. Wildcards permitted. Look up
# VB's Like operator for details.
Address=admin@127.0.0.1
Address=admin@192.168.*
Address=admin@10.*
# The password. It can take any of the following formats:
# 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF (Raw MD5 bytes in HEXstring notation.)
# $b64'dmd5 (Base64 encode of the raw MD5 bytes (you can use TCL's base64 and md5 packages like so: base64::encode [md5 blah]))
# $salt$b66 (Use Unreal's /mkpasswd md5.)
# @ClearText (Clear text password [DISCOURAGED].)
# For example, these three strings represent the same password.
#Password=dcf7fb88d38b9cbc0719c4d47af0b9ca
#Password=$3Pf7iNOLnLwHGcTUevC5yg==
Password=$DK2KE+qZ$Bui7o4cxkRzpK8HLx8TvNg==
#Password=@TestPass
# The permission flags:
# f = Manual Fix (CHANFIX channel)
# F = Force Manual Fix (CHANFIX channel OVERRIDE, OPNICKS)
# c = Query Channel (SCORE channel, CSCORE channel, HISTORY <channel>)
# C = Query Channel User (SCORE channel nick/user@host, SCORE channel nick/user@host, OPLIST)
# o = Operator (Quickie for fFcC)
# n = Note Channel (ADDNOTE, DELNOTE, ALERT, UNALERT)
# b = Block Channel (BLOCK, UNBLOCK)
# a = Administrator (All of the above plus: MODE, KICK, CLEAR, FORGETCHAN, OPME (if enabled))
