25/06/2005 - aquanight
-[CF] [New] Everything. ChanFix is the newest addition to the set of services modules with this commit :) .
            (What's left to do be done here: implement all the commands. Test it.)
-[CO] [CVS] Forgot to add Database.vb... fixed.

26/04/2005 (Update #2) - aquanight
Whoops, jumped the gun a bit on the last update:
-[NS] [Fix] Enforcement timers now properly deleted when the user changes nick. (Of course, it'll
            start over if they pick another reg'd nick.)

26/04/2005 - aquanight
-[NS] [Add] Added nick enforcement, and handling of "registered" usermodes.
-[DS] [Add] Added TIMEDMSG for testing of core timers.

23/04/2005 - aquanight
-[DS] [Fix] Fixed non-IRCops being able to issue commands anyway.
-[CO] [Add] Added modular database driver system. WinSE database loading is basically modulized!
-[DB] [Add] INIDB - Added INIDB - a database driver module for INI files.
-[--] [Upd] Updated winse.conf.example : Database section removed as databases are handled by
            modules.
-[NS] [Add] REGISTER and IDENTIFY work now. That's about it though. Nick tracking, enforcement,
            etc do not work yet - and won't until I add a timer system (threaded timers suck).
-[CO] [Fix] Fixed a bug that might occur on /module services.* and DEFINATELY occured when data
            loading was implemented.

13/04/2005 - aquanight
-[PR] [Add] Unreal - Basically finished now.
-[CO] [Add] WinSE is now capable of linking to an UnrealIRCd server! YAY!
-[DS] [Add] Commands DUMPCLIENT and DIE.
-[CO] [Fix] Massively changed Help.
-[CO] [Add] CONFIGURATION FILE. Tada... Module configs are still TODO, but hopefully soon, they will be TODONE :P .

02/04/2005 - aquanight
Yes it's been a while but here's the next update :) .
-[PR] [Add] Unreal - Bunch of commands implemented. We might be able to actually connect now, if not for the missing parts.

06/03/2005 - aquanight
-[CO] [Add] Some API additions, and lots of them including the Channel and User mode parser, and permission flags are back.
-[PR] [Add] Unreal - Finished up most of the sending stuff, now working on receiving. Heck, this thing might be able to link if not for
            the fact that config and module loading don't exist yet... :P

12/02/2005 - aquanight
-[**] [Add] Filled in AssemblyInfo.vb in everything, so that everything has proper version numbers, exe/dll info, etc.
-[DS] [Add] DebugServ not automatically built in the Release configuration.
-A few other things I don't remember...

10/02/2005 - aquanight
- Initial import of .NET CVS!
