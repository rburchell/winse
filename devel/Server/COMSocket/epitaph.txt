-- HERE LIES THE REMAINS OF COMSOCKET v1 --

June 18, 2004 - August 1, 2004

A great component of Winse has expired this day...
It greatly improved the stability of Winse's socket handling...
But it was slow in the startup...
and installing was a pain in the butt...
Let this folder remain as a reminder to any who try to integrate VB6
and .NET...

COMSocket v2 will be coming soon which will improve these two issues
(and hopefully not introduce any others...)
