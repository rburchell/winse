  -FJOIN and FPART seem to lag some... [-] #0002
  -CS doesnt always seem to successfully set the  topic of a registered channel. [-] #0003
 [w00t]
  -Make QUIT _also_ destroy channel if necessary. [!cant really be done till #0008] #0004
  -Check for access to run NS\CS list, and to view email address... 
   perhaps dont hide at all, since only access 10+ able to run...? [?] #0005
  -Make replies for all commands (failure and success) and use them. #0006
 [aquanight]
  -Tracking of all modes, new mode parser. [!] #0007 [DONE]

[-----------------------------------]

23/07/2004 - Jason
 -[AG] [---] Modified deoper to use "SVSO Nick -" on unreal servers (designed specificly to clear oper flags on those servers)
 -[CO] [---] Added a ServerType config directive, to allow for more efficent server-specific ways of doing things.
23/07/2004 - aquanight
 -[DB] [Fix] Squashed a few compilation errors.
 -[CO] [Fix] Also fixed a potential crash in the new mode parser in
             situations such as a user KILLed by services has an op
             waiting in the receive buffer.
 -[CO] [---] Retired the old mode parser. SetChannelModes is now the
             new mode parser.
22/07/2004 - Jason
 -[CO] [---] Replaced the Usermodes Parser
19/07/2004 - aquanight
 -[CO] [---] It's been a while, and I bring you an improved DB routine! Yay!
04/07/2004 - aquanight
 -[US] [:-)] Happy 4th all you US people! ^_^
 -[CO] [---] Finished the new channel mode parser - the service callbacks are called now (I hope).
             I still haven't replaced the old one yet. I think we should
             finish implementing the new one before that. :)
 -[CO] [---] Implemented a new command parser, but haven't replaced the
             old one yet. We make use of a class module to implement
             the commands. They are seperate subs and invoked using
             Late Binding (CallByName). This means implementing new
             commands is as easy as simply adding a Sub to this class!
             Soon, I'll add stubs to the service modules to do extra
             stuff for commands (like ChanServ deopping the first joiner
             and NickServ doing it's thing :P ).
 -[**] [---] Removed a couple modules that aren't used any more.
 -[CO] [---] Added a rater basic data access module. It will probably improve in usabilty soon. I don't suggest using it right away :) .
29/06/2004 - aquanight
 -[CO] [---] Added a new channel mode parser, but haven't replaced the old one just yet.
 -[CS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
 -[NS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
 -[OS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
 -[AS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
 -[RS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
 -[AG] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
 -[MS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
27/06/2004 - w00t

 -[CS] [Fix] Now uses basMain.ParseBuffer rather than doing manually :)
 -[AS] [Fix] Now uses basMain.ParseBuffer rather than doing manually :)
