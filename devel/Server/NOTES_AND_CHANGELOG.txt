 10/09/2004 - aquanight
  -[DB] [Fix] Added winse.mdb to the repository. Also adjusted constraints and field types.
              I noticed that some of the names were not what I planned to use. I guess
              we will need to update WinSE with the actual field names...
              The database itself is Access 200 Format. Please make sure you have this
              or a later version.
              SPECIAL NOTE: If directly modifying the database is necessary (such as
              adjusting field properties), be SURE to Compact the database so that it takes
              as little room as possible; that way we don't go uploading 394542MB files to
              SourceForge's CVS servers...
 07/09/2004 - w00t
  -[MS] [Fix] Fixed DEL old index crap
  -[MS] [Fix] Re-wrote DEL so it works :p
  -[MS] [Fix] DEL ALL also works now! :p
 06/09/2004 - aquanight
  -[MS] [Fix] Squashed some old index stuffs.
  -[CO] [Fix] Added IndexOf to the collections.
  -[RS] [Fix] Fixed an old index usage.
  -[MS] [Fix] Fixed a w00tism in MemoServ READ.
 05/09/2004 - aquanight
  As reported by w00t:
  -[CS] [Fix] Removed bouncy modes for now, I do want to be able to _run_ cvs...
              -- actually bouncy modes are finished now, but presently disabled (#If 0)
                 until DB crap is finished.
  -[CS] [Fix] Fixed aquanight's silly use of my CommandHelp ;) (hint: You only need
              to specify the folder name thats IN app.path & "\help" not the whole thing :)
              --whoops :/ . Don't know why I did that - might have been a documentation
                thing. Guess I'll get started on doc'ing the API sometime.
  -[CO] [Fix] Fixed aquanight's braindead mistake in SendMessage. (We want to send to
              _reciever_ not _sender_)
              -- Actually it was attempting to use the wrong preference - trying to get a
                 user record for ChanServ - which doesn't have one. Whoops.
  -[CO] [Fix] Updated MOTD so it doesnt use the old basMain.Users any more.
              -- eheh <.< I must've missed it.
  -[CO] [Fix] Fixed some aquanight silliness that broke collections. 
              -- typo. I swear.
  -[CO] [Fix] Fixed some more old basMain.Users stuff.
              -- Whee! Examples include some old usage in NickServ and DebugServ.
                 When we switched to the new user tracker I had added some warnings to help
                 catch some of these. There may be stuff still trying to use User indexes
                 and haven't been updated _at all_ yet.
  -[CO] [???] w00t claims he has some db stuff, but I haven't seen it yet...
  So I guess we no longer have a "perfect" coder. Waaah. Cry about it why don't you :P .
  Seriously, though, that's the last time I commit something before checking it. I hope.
  Oh, and now for my own fixes/adds.
  -[CS] [Add] As mentioned, the Prefix Mode Bouncer is finished now, but it won't be
              functional (as with the rest of ChanServ) until the DB stuff is finished.
              AFAIK, Channy is the only service using the new dbs >:) . Guess I'll think
              about updating NickServ sometime...
  -[CO] [Add] I'm not so sure if this is a good idea, but I added a default property to User
              to fetch the nickname. This will also send a warning showing that someone is
              using old code. Maybe I should just leave this to the compiler to scream
              about, but...
  -[DS] [Fix] Fixed DebugServ DUMPUSER. It was still using old indexes.
  -[CO] [Add] Something I neglected to mention earlier - User objects now have a Dispose
              method which will remove all references of the object from the global
              Users and Channels collections, used for users who were removed by some event
              such as QUIT, KILL, or by our own doings (KillUser, SVSKillUser).
  -[CO] [Add] Which also brings up the addition of SVSKillUser so that we can now simply
              use a method call to use SVSKILL. I think it would be simple to add IRCd
              checks to determine if we should use KILL (because SVSKILL doesn't exist
              for example).
  -[CO] [Add] One day I was reading the Anope source and stumbled on an uh oh. Bahamut
              supposedly sends a QUIT as a response to SVSKILL. ParseCmd will now handle
              unknown users correctly - send 'em a KILL and bail out, but I think
              SVSKillUser will need to simply send the SVSKILL and not Dispose() the User
              on Bahamut...
              Actually, I somewhat recall seeing this occur while telnetting around. :)
 01/09/2004 - aquanight
  -[CO] [Add] Some debug logging, huzzah :D 01/09/2004 - aquanight
  -[CS] [Add] We can now bounce some invalid +vhoaq changes (but not all yet).
  -[CO] [Fix] Fixed a nick tracking issue in the channel members collection.
  -[CO] [Fix] Fixed a "stupid me" issue with the mode callbacks - forgot a source parameter!
  -[CO] [Fix] Fixed a Jasonism in User.HasFlag.
 29/08/2004 - aquanight
  -[CO] [Fix] Unw00ted the config parser. Yay.
  -[CO] [Fix] Fixed a nick tracking issue in user collections.
  -[MS] [Fix] Unw00ted it a bit. It used the old user stuffs. It has been updated.
 29/08/2004 - w00t
  -[MS] [Add] I BRING THEE MEMOSERV. In really basic form ;p. Doesn't have database stuff yet.
              This is probably going to break CVS until we fix userstructure, etc to work with it.
  -[MS] [Add] Added memoserv help files. Whoopee.
  -[AL] [Fix] Fixed aquanight's date silliness :)

 25/08/2004 - aquanight
  -[AL] [---] Changed the Service(<number>) references to use symbolic constants instead of
              "magic numbers". Now we actually know what Service(SVSINDEX_GLOBAL) means,
              as opposed to a cryptic Service(8).
  -[CS] [---] Implemented Register and started on Identify. Register correctly checks for
              illegal attempts, and Identify only has two checks (and doesn't have the
              success code yet :P ).
  -[DB] [---] Updated the channel DB description to correctly include all the fields we
              should need. I hope I didn't miss any. Maybe if I get MySQL installed, I'll
              create the actual databases :P .
 22/08/2004 - Jason
  -[MsS][---] Cleaned up some commented out, to never again be used code.
  -[MsS][---] Changed the source name in some error logging output, to save us from debug nightmares
 21/08/2004 - aquanight
  -[CS] [---] Getting ready for the redesign - I've laid out the base commands :) .
  -[CO] [---] Added some functions to add mIRC formatting.
  -[CO] [---] Another rewrite of the DB API :( .
  -[CO] [---] ADMIN command implemented.
  -[CO] [---] Added User.Dispose, to remove all references to a user. Use this for things
              like KILL, SVSKILL, QUIT, etc.
 09/08/2004 - aquanight
  -[AL] [---] Changed the whole user and channel tracking mechanisms, because I got
              sick of mucking with arrays and standard collections and what not.
              We are now slightly more object-oriented - which we should have been
              from the start ;p . I don't know how stable things are, so be on the
              lookout.
 7/08/2004 - Jason
  -[MsS][---] Added MKILL and CHANKILL, CHANGLINE is on my ToDo list
 03/08/2004 - aquanight / w00t
  -[CO] [---] IT'S A MIRACLE! Due to the benevolent wonders of CVS,
              COMSocket is back and cranking out bytes again. However,
              you will need to (re)compile it yourself now. I have added
              a readme.txt which explains the process.
  -[CO] [---] CODING_GUIDELINES.txt added.
  -[CO] [---] Directory help added. w00t has implemented a new help
              system. Reeks of auspice, but hey :) it'll be much
              eaiser to update!
 01/08/2004 - aquanight
  -[CO] [---] R.I.P. COMSocket. It was a great component in it's day
              but it had two very unfortunate negativities:
              - It was slow to load when Winse starts (or the first time
                it is started while in the IDE). This is an unfortunate
                result of the required .NET Framework being loaded.
              - MSI Installers suck, and writing my own was just too
                convoluted. NSIS may have worked, but poop.
              So Winse is officially "broken" as it no longer has socket
              access anywhere, until further notice. We will have to
              continue developing blindly until a new socket library
              is put in. (BOO MSWinSock OCX FOREVER!)
 01/08/2004 - w00t
  Yes, I actually work occasionally :)
  --- A few notes and observations ---  
    -I am having problems with the removal of channels... join a chan,
     connect services, disconnect and then reconnect services. Errors.
    -USE LOGGING FFS. Don't just NotifyAllUsersWithAccess, LogEventWithMessage does that AND logs! since I
     really want us to USE THE FSCKING LOGS! I am tired of not getting errors, since I am not identified...
     Besides, what if nobody is connected! I am sorry, but this really irks me... While on the subject of
     logging, we need more debug logging detailing what gets sent where, so if it DOES error, we can 
     guess why. Rant over.
    -Don't use debug.print, use LOGGING! that's why it's there! I don't have an immediate window!
    -Create replies for stuff, don't use english anywhere! We want language independance!!
    -Jason: We already have Config.UplinkType, was it necessary to create Config.ServerType to do the same thing?
     as well as that, I specify Unreal32 as future versions may use a different protocol.
    Err, right. That's about it. Sorry if this breaks your CVS, but it really had to be done :)
  --- End Notes (rants) ---
  -[AL] [---] Added CODING_GUIDELINES.txt, read it.
  -[CO] [---] Added VERSION support, means /version services.* does something.
  -[CO] [---] Added MOTD support, sent on new user connect and on /motd services.*
  -[CO] [---] Removed old shit (comments etc), indented code.
  -[CO] [Fix] Added LOADS of replies, used them.
  -[CO] [Fix] Fixed loads of 438 errors on the command dispatcher.
  -[AG] [Fix] Fixed some braindead Jason stuff, like checking for locops, removing netadmin
 30/07/2004 - Jason
  -[MsS][---] Finished MassServ (Except for AllBotJoin AllBotPart as botserv isnt done)
 30/07/2004 - aquanight
  -[CO] [---] Moved ParseConfigurationFile to basMain.
  -[DB] [---] Added a few things to the DB API.
  -[DB] [---] Increased the abstraction level of the DB API by making
              basFileIO not dependent on the application directory.
              In other words, filenames to basFileIO and basDBAccess
              now require full paths or paths relative to the working
              directory (CurDir()).
 29/07/2004 - aquanight
  -[--] [---] Did some more cleanup, removing code that was no longer
              used.
  -[CO] [---] Added a new event for services - every so often (can be
              adjusted by changing tmrSVSTick.Interval) a callback
              procedure can be called in each of the services modules.
  -[CS] [---] Added some new subs to handle timed events.
  -[NS] [---] Added some new subs to handle timed events.
  -[OS] [---] Added some new subs to handle timed events.
  -[AS] [---] Added some new subs to handle timed events.
  -[RS] [---] Added some new subs to handle timed events.
  -[AG] [---] Added some new subs to handle timed events.
  -[MsS][---] Added some new subs to handle timed events.
  -[CO] [---] Squashed a few bugs.
  -[DS] [---] For debugging, added INDEXOFUSER, INDEXOFCHANNEL, DUMPUSER
              and DUMPCHANNEL. Permission checks to come later.
 28/07/2004 - Jason
  -[CO] [---] Made basFuncitons.NotifyAllUsersWithFlags(Flag As String, Message As String)
              Only takes one flag
  -[AG] [---] Made Config Directive AbuseTeamPrivacy (Read comments in the config)
  -[CO] [Fix] Typos in SetFlags
  -[AS] [Fix] Security fix in AdminServ ACCESS
  -[AS] [Fix] Duplicate declarations in AdminServ ACCESS
  -[AS] [Fix] Bugfix in AdminServ ACCESS
  -[MsS][Fix] Security fix in MassServ (Missing NOT)
  -[OS] [Fix] Security fix in OperServ (Missing NOT)
  -[AG] [Fix] Help in agent had a duplicate DENY entry
  -[AG] [---] Agent KILL Improvement: * Quits: L4m3n00b (Ident@Host) (Killed (MrAnnoyed (Go away!)))
 26/07/2004 - w00t
  -[--] [---] Reformatted the changelog. Maybe it looks prettyful now. :P
 26/07/2004 - Jason
  -[RS] [---] RootServ Inject can inject to Oper services with the exception of
              AdminServ and Agent if the proper config directive is set and the
              user has the "I" (AccFlagCanRootServSuperInject) flag
  -[RS] [---] RootServ Inject is no longer restricted to Masters, but to its own flag
  -[CO] [---] Added a permissions flag for recieving services notices by
              NotifyAllUsersWithServicesAccess.  Only users with flag "g"
              (AccFlagGetServNotices) recieve the notices now.
  -[AL] [---] Complete Overhaul of the permissions system, we now use flags,
              the flag letters are selected by changing constants in basMain
 25/07/2004 - Jason
  -[AG] [Fix] Numerous bugfixes, I tested it well, then fixed everything that was broken
 25/07/2004 - aquanight
  -[--] [---] I got enough complaints that COMSocket was difficult to
              register (you have to use the .NET SDK's RegAsm tool
              instead of the usual regsvr32), so I made an MSI installer
              that will sort things out.
              Location: COMSocket\COMSocketInstaller\Debug\Setup.exe
              Also added is the Visual Studio .NET 2003 Project File
              to generate the MSI. Naturally building this will need to
              build the COMSocket DLL itself, which will register it ;p .
  -[AG] [Fix] Squashed a ton of compile errors in DoOper and Deny (sorry Jason ;p ).
  -[CO] [Fix] Fixed a problem with CallByName not working in ParseCmd,
              partly VB6's fault for not marking the last parameter as
              ParamArray (it is just a Variant array), even though it is
              treated as such.
 25/07/2004 - Jason
  -[MsS][---] Coded OPERINVITE (Invite all opers to a chan, but dont force them in)
  -[MsS][---] Coded ALLINVITE (Invite all users to a chan, but dont force them in)
  -[AL] [Fix] Since SVS2MODE only works on Unreal, made checks for ServerType
 24/07/2004 - Jason
  -[MsS][---] Coded MassServ OPERJOIN
  -[RS] [---] Added rootserv INJECT, Services Master can INJECT to non-ircop services
  -[--] [---] DENY ADD now also automaticly enforces all active denys.
  -[AG] [Fix] Bugfix for DENY on Unreal
  -[AG] [Fix] Bugfix for DENY on other systems
  -[--] [---] Yes, Those two ^ were seperate bugs.
  -[AG] [---] DENY on non-Unreal: improvement in case flag +O, +A etc can be used without +o
  -[AG] [---] Services Master was already exempt from access=0, made him exempt from oper deny restrictions
 23/07/2004 - Jason
  -[AG] [---] Added a DENY feature, Hostmask based deny keeps services access 0
              during NS IDENTIFY and immediately reverses any OPERs
  -[AG] [---] Modified deoper to use "SVSO Nick -" on unreal servers (designed specificly to clear oper flags on those servers)
 23/07/2004 -  aquanight
  -[--] [---] So many updates on one day! :)
  -[CS] [---] Added some new subs to handle usermode changes coming in from the IRCd.
              Added some new subs to handle commands coming in from the IRCd.
  -[NS] [---] Added some new subs to handle usermode changes coming in from the IRCd.
              Added some new subs to handle commands coming in from the IRCd.
  -[OS] [---] Added some new subs to handle usermode changes coming in from the IRCd.
              Added some new subs to handle commands coming in from the IRCd.
  -[AS] [---] Added some new subs to handle usermode changes coming in from the IRCd.
        [---] Added some new subs to handle commands coming in from the IRCd.
  -[RS] [---] Added some new subs to handle usermode changes coming in from the IRCd.
        [---] Added some new subs to handle commands coming in from the IRCd.
  -[AG] [---] Added some new subs to handle usermode changes coming in from the IRCd.
              Added some new subs to handle commands coming in from the IRCd.
  -[MsS][---] Added some new subs to handle usermode changes coming in from the IRCd.
  -[MsS][---] Added some new subs to handle commands coming in from the IRCd.
  -[CO] [---] Added a ServerType config directive, to allow for more efficent server-specific ways of doing things.
 23/07/2004 - aquanight
  -[DB] [Fix] Squashed a few compilation errors.
  -[CO] [Fix] Also fixed a potential crash in the new mode parser in
              situations such as a user KILLed by services has an op
              waiting in the receive buffer.
  -[CO] [---] Retired the old mode parser. SetChannelModes is now the
              new mode parser.
 22/07/2004 - Jason
  -[CO] [---] Replaced the Usermodes Parser
 19/07/2004 - aquanight
  -[CO] [---] It's been a while, and I bring you an improved DB routine! Yay!
 04/07/2004 - aquanight
  -[US] [:-)] Happy 4th all you US people! ^_^
  -[CO] [---] Finished the new channel mode parser - the service callbacks are called now (I hope).
              I still haven't replaced the old one yet. I think we should
              finish implementing the new one before that. :)
  -[CO] [---] Implemented a new command parser, but haven't replaced the
              old one yet. We make use of a class module to implement
              the commands. They are seperate subs and invoked using
              Late Binding (CallByName). This means implementing new
              commands is as easy as simply adding a Sub to this class!
              Soon, I'll add stubs to the service modules to do extra
              stuff for commands (like ChanServ deopping the first joiner
              and NickServ doing it's thing :P ).
  -[**] [---] Removed a couple modules that aren't used any more.
  -[CO] [---] Added a rather basic data access module. It will probably improve in usabilty soon. I don't suggest using it right away :) .
29/06/2004 - aquanight
  -[CO] [---] Added a new channel mode parser, but haven't replaced the old one just yet.
  -[CS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
  -[NS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
  -[OS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
  -[AS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
  -[RS] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
  -[AG] [---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
  -[MsS][---] Added some new subs to handle mode changes coming in from the IRCd.
 27/06/2004 - w00t
  -[CO] [Fix] Added config file support, needs EXTENSIVE testing. (this was fun! :D)
  -[CO] [---] Changed a lot of references to fully qualified names, eg ServerName -> basMain.Config.ServerName
 26/06/2004 - w00t
  -[AS] [Fix] JUPE added, needs testing. [update: now should check for "fishy" names :o]
  -[CO] [Fix] KillServer renamed DelServer since I like it better! :P
 25/06/2004 - w00t
  -[CO] [Fix] Logging to file now works! (Pinched from my Messenger application :P)
  -[CO] [Fix] We no longer respond to PING, since we PING our uplink.
  -[CO] [Fix] If we recieve ERROR :whatever from server, we finish up and die.
  -[NS] [Fix] Now uses basMain.ParseBuffer rather than doing manually :)
  -[MsS] [Bug] Fixed RTE on SERVJOIN/SERVPART
  -[AG] [Bug] Fixed RTE in Agent UNIDENTIFY if no parameters were given =|
  -[AG] [Fix] Added DEOPER.
/* 0.0.3.3-noesis */
 24/06/2004 - w00t
  -[CO] [Bug] Fixed GetSender\GetTarget. -aquanight, you will need to see why your code failed!
  -[CO] [Fix] Reintroduced a whole lot of stuff from when we rewrote tcpServer_GetData
  -[CO] [Bug] Changed basFunctions.KillUser var Killer to default to "Agent" rather than "" since "" causes BIIIG stuffups.
  -[CO] [Bug] Fixed SQUIT not being sent on shutdown.
  -[CS] [Fix] Now uses basMain.ParseBuffer rather than doing manually :)
  -[AS] [Fix] Now uses basMain.ParseBuffer rather than doing manually :)
  -[AS] [Bug] Fixed ACCESS looking for the wrong nick in the DB!
  -[AL] [Fix] Updated copyright headers to reflect "winse team" rather than just me :)
 21/06/2004 - w00t
  -[CO] [Fix] Added Replies.SanityCheck* stuff and use them! (yay)
  -[AL] [Fix] "All" code created, use "AL" (I liiiike two digit codes :P)
 18/06/2004 - aquanight
  -[AL] [---] Option Explicit added to all remaining modules.
  -[AL] [---] Explicit type specifications added.
  -[AL] [---] Some functions changed to subs, since they didnt return anything.
  -[CO] [Fix] Code cleanup, mostly in basFunctions.
  -[CO] [Fix] MSWinsock replaced with a .NET/COM component
 15/06/2004 - w00t
  -[CO] [Bug] Undeclared variables declared
  -[AS] [Bug] Option Explicit enabled.
