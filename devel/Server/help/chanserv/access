Syntax: ACCESS <#channelname> {ADD|SET} <nick> <flags>
        ACCESS <#channelname> DEL <nick>
        ACCESS <#channelname> LIST

The ADD and SET commands have the same effect:
- If the user is not on the access list, that user is added with the given flags.
- If the user is on the access list, his flags are modified according to the flags parameter.
The flags parameter is a set of characters indicating what flags to add or remove. It uses the
same syntax as the IRC /MODE command, meaning that flags to be added are placed after a +, and
flags to be removed are placed after a -. For example: +kc-i+za-l means to add kc, remove i, add
za, remove l. For a list of character flags and their effect, type /msg ChanServ HELP FLAGS.

DEL deletes a user from the access list.

LIST shows all access list entries.
