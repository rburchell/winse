Syntax: REGISTER <#channelname> <password> <description>
This registers a channel with the password and description given,
and adds your name as the channel founder.

It is strongly recommended that you add a successor for your channel.
Should your nick expire before the channel does, the successor will
become the founder of your channel. If you did not set a successor
however, the channel will be dropped, and all settings will be lost,
and anyone with Channel Operator status on the channel (@) will be
permitted to REGISTER the channel again.
