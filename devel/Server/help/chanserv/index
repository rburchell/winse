ChanServ Commands:
  ChanServ is used to register and control channels. With this, you can ensure that a
  channel remains yours, so you can do what you wish with it. It is not intended to be
  a method of facilitating channel takeovers, or being overtly hostile towards others.
  Abuse of ChanServ can result in, at a minimum, loss of registered channels.
 
  ChanServ is publically available.
