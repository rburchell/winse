Ok people, these are the helpfiles for the dynamic helpsystem. When you change
a command's syntax, change it here too. When you add one, add it here. When you
delete one, NOTE it here (ie Nick grouping isnt supported with these services,
use LINK.) or whatever. I'll probably add preprocessing directives like #INCLUDe
so you can automatically include the contents of files and stuff... but thats
all for the future, and will have to wait for more critical stuff.

The main helpfile (the one sent on /msg servicename help) is called "index"

Helpfile format:

Syntax: COMAMNDNAME <neededparam> [optionalparam]
Help for command goes here. For a blank line, use a space at the start of the line

Have fun!
